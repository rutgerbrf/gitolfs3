Yes, this is indeed an integration between Gitolite, Git LFS and Scaleway
Object Storage.

To be honest, the code is pretty bad right now and solely serves my needs.
Although I will be doing some cleanups, I have no interest in making this
program work for people with different use cases than me. In case you want to
use this software, feel free to, but expect that you will basically have to
'make it your own'.
